// Package dedupkeep provides strategies for deciding which duplicate file to keep.

// This file contains legacy implementations that have been replaced by function-based
// approaches in functions.go. The DefaultOldestFileStrategy struct is no longer needed.
// Use keep.OldestFile() function instead.
