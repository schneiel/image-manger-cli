// Package dedupkeep provides strategies for deciding which duplicate file to keep.

// This file contains legacy implementations that have been replaced by function-based
// approaches in functions.go. The DefaultShortestPathStrategy struct is no longer needed.
// Use keep.ShortestPath() function instead.
